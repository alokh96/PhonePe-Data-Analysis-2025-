# PhonePe-Data-Analysis-2025-
# Overview:
In this study, the PhonePe Pulse dataset—which includes detailed information about digital transactions throughout India—is analyzed.  To find out more about UPI usage, transaction growth, and user distribution across states and districts, an interactive Power BI dashboard needed to be created once the data had been cleaned and transformed using Python.

# Tech Stack:
Python (Colab, Pandas, Numpy) – Data Cleaning & Transformation

Power BI – Dashboarding & Visualization

PhonePe Pulse Dataset – Public dataset on UPI transactions in India

# Project Workflow:
**1.Data Cleaning (Python – Colab)**

- Imported and explored raw PhonePe Pulse data.

- Removed duplicates and handled missing values.

- Standardized column names and formats.

- Extracted new features (Year, Quarter, State, Transaction Type).

- Exported clean dataset for visualization

**2.Dashboard Creation (Power BI)**

- Built an interactive dashboard with multiple pages and slicers.

Key visuals included:

- Line Charts – Transaction trends by year/quarter.

- Bar Charts – Top states/districts by transaction value.

- Maps – Geographical distribution of UPI adoption.

- Donut/Stacked Charts – Payment modes & user growth.

**3. Insights & Findings**

- Strong adoption of UPI in Tier-1 cities, with increasing penetration in Tier-2/3 regions.

- Noticeable seasonal spikes in transactions during festive months.

- States like Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Telangana consistently showed high transaction volumes.

# Key Highlights:

- End-to-end workflow from raw dataset → cleaned dataset → interactive dashboard.

- Demonstrated data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and storytelling with data.

- Scalable for further use cases like forecasting, anomaly detection, and trend analysis.

# How to Use:

- Open the Python notebook (Colab/Jupyter) for data cleaning steps.

- Use the phonepe_project.pbix file to explore the Power BI dashboard.

- Interact with filters (Year, Quarter, State, Transaction Type) to generate insights.
